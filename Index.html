                <p class="introp">Hi there! I'm <span style="color: orange;">Sharmin</span> , a Frontend Development Enthusiast.
            
                I am a 3rd semester Computer Engineering student at the American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB), with a strong interest in web development. Currently, I am learning HTML and CSS, and I am eager to expand my skills in frontend technologies.
                
                In addition to web development, I have a solid foundation in programming with C and C++, and I am actively practicing data structures and algorithms to enhance my problem-solving abilities. My education and projects at AIUB have equipped me with a good understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.
                
                As I continue my journey in web development, I am excited to build more projects and showcase my growing skills. Please feel free to explore my portfolio and see what I have been working on. Don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or offer feedback.</p>
